heart diseases prediction:
1. Hue is HEART DISEASES
2.“The dataset contains X rows and Y columns related to heart disease diagnosis. It includes both numerical and categorical variables such as age, cholesterol, sex, chest pain type, etc.”
3.“There are no missing values, and data types are correctly formatted.
4.“The target variable is imbalanced, with 70% in class 0. Resampling may be needed.”
5.Age: Mean age = 54.3, with most patients between 45–60.
6.Cholesterol: Right-skewed distribution, with outliers > 400 mg/dL
7.Age and cholesterol are normally distributed, though cholesterol has significant outliers.”
8.Chest pain type (cp) has a strong positive correlation with the presence of heart disease. thalach and oldpeak are negatively correlated with heart disease. No multicollinearity observed.”
9.No need for heavy data cleaning. Dataset is ready for feature scaling and model building.
